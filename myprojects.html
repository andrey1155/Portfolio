                <h2>Point dynamics</h2>

                <p class="projects-text-description">This project was made in the autumn of 2019 during the study of theoretical mechanics. The goal was to create a program that allows one to simulate the movement of a material point as well as a 3D body in space. At the same time, this was my first C++ program ever that I wrote without YouTube or university teacher's guidance. Although not all the objectives were achieved, this project is considered to be a success.</p>

                    reference but is far from identical. There is also an assembly compiler, written (by me) for this machine.
